Usage:
sudo ./create.sh "www.site.com"

OR:
sudo ./create.sh


What it does:
It creates a config file in the defined apache site-available [/etc/apache2/sites-available] directory,
symlinks it to the sites-enabled [/etc/apache2/sites-enabled]
Creates a www.site.com directory in the apache log dir [/var/log/apache2], and touches error.log and access.log in it.

It sets the servername to www.site.com, the document root to [/var/www/www.site.com] and the proper logfiles.

WARNING:
the /var/www/www.site.com is not handled yet properly. Check the script if you'd like to customize the location.
